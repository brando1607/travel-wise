# TravelWise

A scalable, modular travel management platform built using **NestJS** microservices. TravelWise enables users to manage bookings, authenticate via various providers, and enjoy personalized features like frequent user perks â€” with more services (like email notifications) coming soon.

---

## Overview

TravelWise is composed of several services working together in a microservices architecture. It is designed with separation of concerns, allowing each domain (auth, bookings, frequent users and emais) to evolve independently and scale as needed.

---

## Services

- **API Gateway**  
  Central entry point for client interactions. Handles routing, authentication, and request delegation to microservices.  
  Includes:

  - Local and JWT authentication strategies
  - Custom Guards, Interceptors, and Exception Filters

- **Auth Service**  
  Handles:

  - User registration and login
  - Password hashing with `bcrypt`
  - JWT creation and verification

- **Frequent Users Service**  
  Allows:

  - Retrieval of all or a single user.
  - User modification.
  - User deletion.

---

## Tech Stack

### Core Framework

- **NestJS** â€” a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable applications using TypeScript and Express under the hood.

### Authentication

- `passport-local`, `passport-jwt` â€” local and token-based strategies
- `@nestjs/jwt` â€” JWT generation and validation

### Security

- `bcrypt` â€” password hashing
- `cookie-parser` â€” reading and writing cookies (used in login/logout flows)
- `crypto` - email encryption and hashing

### Inter-service Communication

- `@nestjs/microservices` â€” message-based communication between services over TCP.

### Database

- **Prisma ORM** with PostgreSQL â€” used in `auth`, `bookings`, and `frequent-users` services.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

Each service lives in its own folder within the repository:

```
/api-gateway
/auth
/bookings
/frequent-users
```

### Communication

Microservices communicate using **NestJS transport layers**, enabling **loose coupling**. The API Gateway acts as the **entry point**, delegating requests to internal services.

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via the local strategy.
2. API Gateway creates a signed JWT and sends it via an HTTP-only cookie
3. Subsequent requests include the cookie; the Gateway validates the token via JWT strategy and sets `req.user`
4. User is authorized through custom guards

## What's to come.

The TravelWise platform is actively evolving. Upcoming features and enhancements include:

-- Enhanced Authentication
Integration of Passport strategies for:

GitHub login

Google login

-- Email Notifications Service
A dedicated Email Service will handle transactional emails for both users and bookings:

- User Events
  Welcome email after registration

Temporary password for account recovery

Password change confirmation

Profile update confirmation

Alert after 3 failed login attempts

Account blocked notification

- Booking Events
  Confirmation email when a booking is created

Notification for booking updates

Cancellation email

-- Inter-service Communication
Transition to RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging between microservices
(ensuring better scalability and fault tolerance)

-- Smart Booking Options (Concept in Progress)
The Bookings service will allow users to input an origin and destination (via address or airport). Based on the distance, the system will suggest:

Car trips

Train journeys

Flights

To achieve this, it will integrate with Google Maps APIs:

Places API â€” to get latitude and longitude from location names

Distance Matrix API â€” to calculate distances and travel durations

This module is still under active design and development.

ðŸ§  Caching & Optimization
Redis will be used for:

Caching frequently accessed data

Rate limiting and temporary state tracking

Caching data entered during booking process
